# My First Blog Post

Published on: 2022-07-01

Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro! Here I shall share my learning journey as a website.

## What I have accomplished

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new astro project and set up the environment for it.

2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!

## What's next

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.
